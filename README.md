hello! this project is intended to be a resource providing tournament information and discord links for southern california fighting game communities. i am a strive player so that's what we have right now! 

to do:
*  ~~consolidate css files~~
* learn how to use the start.gg API (V is working on this)
* results page + basic analytics for strive
* literally anything at all for the games i don't know about (yet :))
*  ~~links to other resources (eg. huge list of discord links)~~
*  ~~basic home page~~
